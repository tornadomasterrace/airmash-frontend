                Information we collect
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is a volunteer-run fork of the original Airmash
                game, and our game servers are all run independently.
                The information stored and logged is at the discretion
                of each server operator.
            </p>
            <p>
                The airmash.online website logs every URL requested of it,
                along with the IP address of the requestor. This information
                is used to generate usage statistics and analyze usage patterns.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Social network sign-in
            </h2>
            <p>
                You may log in using Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Reddit or
                Twitch in order to save your settings, account statistics and
                achievements. For each platform, the minimum set of OAuth
                permissions are specified: only publicly accessible data.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will not request access to your contacts, posting
                privileges or account information such as your email. You
                can verify this when signing in or navigating to the Apps
                section of your social network account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platforms like Twitch require the email as a default. In
                that case we will not store your email or use it for
                marketing purposes.
            </p>

                <b>Airmash will never make posts on your behalf, nor will

            <p>
                When joining a game server, it will receive your account
                session ID if you are signed in. Other than the player name
                you choose on the main page, it will not receive any
                further information relating to your identity.

            </h2>
            <p>
                We use HTML5 local storage to store your game settings.
                If you have signed in, we also use this to store your
                account session ID and identity (account name or email
                address). Your identity is not stored or logged on any
                of the servers.

                HTTPS
            </h2>
            <p>
                The website and websocket connections are served over
                secure sockets.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>
                Airmash does not use any external analytics suites such as
                Google Analytics. We do not embed externally hosted social
                media buttons.
